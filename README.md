This is the repository for Evan's 2018 NESSF proposal & NESSF19-R renewal proposal.


### What are the requirements for NESSF19-R? ###

All renewal proposals must use an easily read [typically 12-point] font of no more than 15 characters per horizontal inch, no more than 5.5 lines per vertical inch (i.e., single spaced), and at least one-inch margins on all sides. Non-compliant submissions may be returned without review.

All submissions require that the NSPIRES cover pages be completed online, including a proposal summary/abstract and responses to the Program Specific Data questions, which includes the renewal proposal’s budget.

In addition to filling out the NSPIRES web interface cover pages on line, renewal applications must include the elements 1-5 listed below, clearly identified, each starting on a new page, and appearing in the following order in a single PDF file:

1. A progress report, of approximately three to six pages that summarizes the work accomplished during the previous year, relating the actual accomplishments with the plan originally outlined in the proposal and/or including any unanticipated opportunities, surprises, or unusual developments; and a description of plans for the coming year, including explanations of any substantial deviation from the plan originally outlined in the proposal.
2. An updated schedule for completing the degree program.
3. A signed letter of recommendation from the student’s PI, i.e., faculty advisor on institutional letterhead that must include the name of the student, the name of the proposing institution, and the renewal proposal title. If the student has more than one faculty advisor, the letter may be jointly signed or separate letters may be provided. If there will be a proposed PI change from the current NESSF award, then include a 2-page bio for the new PI. 
4. Official or unofficial, legible, and clearly unaltered transcripts for any classes taken during the previous year. If all or part of the student’s Social Security Number or Date of Birth appears on the transcript, this MUST be blocked out prior to submission. This is the only alteration permitted to a transcript. If no classes were taken in the previous year, provide documentation from the University that the student is still enrolled for a graduate degree at the proposing university.
5. A budget narrative explaining the amounts and why, i.e., details that support the request in Program Specific Data items 7 through 9. If exchanges or adjustments are being made between the stipend and allowance budgets, then provide supporting justifying documentation in addition to the summary. Another example requiring specifics, when the university is committing to reduce or waive tuition and fees for the student, specify that amount in the budget justification and a point of contact at the university who is not the PI or the student. If any travel is being proposed for field work; conferences; etc., then specify cost basis;, location(s); purposes; traveler name;, etc. Be specific about how the requested funds will be allocated and whether the student or the institution is the ultimate recipient. Do not request the full $45,000 in cases when the student will not be spending the funds over 12 months unless it can be fully documented as justified. For example, if the standard university stipend is $35,000 or greater in an academic year (9-10 months), provide the evidence of that fact. Remember to prorate and reduce stipend and allowances requests to account for known student absences of three months or greater.
6. Optional High-End Computing Appendix. The HEC Appendix is a separate PDF file, so do not include it in the PDF file for items 1-5. See Appendix A of this solicitation for details on how to pursue this option. NOTE: If accepted, NASA will allocate this resource to the PI, so it should be the PI’s doing the HEC application  

Reminder: All five of the required proposal elements, which are not part of the NSPIRES cover page forms or an optional HEC appendix, must be combined into a single PDF document and uploaded on the NSPIRES site for submission 

### (2018) What are NASA's requirements for the proposal? ###

New applications must include the elements listed below, clearly identified, starting on a
new page, and appearing in the following order in a single PDF file:

1. A personal statement which outlines a candidate’s goals, experiences, attributes, and academic achievements that, when considered in combination with the other application components, shows academic excellence, as broadly construed (refer to "Proposal Evaluation and Selection"). This section may total no more than one single-spaced uploaded page.
2. A description of the proposed research project, including figures and tables, as appropriate. This section, excluding references, may total no more than six single-spaced uploaded pages. References must follow the project description and are not included in the page limit. The project description should include the following elements:
	* A well-defined problem with a justification of its scientific significance and a detailed approach for its resolution.
	* A statement describing the relevance of the proposed work to the appropriate SMD Division.
	* A timeline for the proposed project listing anticipated accomplishments and major milestones, including expected publications. Although this is initially a one-year award (renewable for two additional years), projects should be scoped for the entire intended length of the award (up to three years).
3. A schedule stating the start and completion dates, as well as anticipated milestones, of the applicant’s degree program;
4. Curriculum Vitae of the faculty advisor and the student, limited to two pages each;
5. A signed letter of recommendation from the student’s academic advisor on institutional letterhead, which must include the name of the student, the name of the proposing institution, and the NESSF proposal title, and should address some of the review criteria from Section 7;
6. A statement signed by both the student and faculty advisor affirming the proposal is the work of the student and has not been written by another team member, such as the advisor, and
7. Unofficial, legible, and clearly unaltered undergraduate and graduate transcripts (provide an explanation if the transcripts are not current or recent). If all or part of the applicant’s Social Security Number or Date of Birth appears on the transcript, this MUST be blocked out prior to submission. This is the only alteration permitted to a transcript. Please note: All of these required proposal elements, which are not part of the NSPIRES cover page forms, must be combined into a single PDF document and uploaded on the NSPIRES site for submission


### How will proposals be selected? ###

The Directors of the Science Divisions of SMD at NASA Headquarters or their designees
will make respective selection of applications for award on a competitive basis. Criteria
for evaluation include:

* the scientific merit of the proposed research;
* the relevance of the proposed research to NASA’s objectives in Earth or space science as outlined above; and
* academic excellence based upon an applicant's personal statement, transcripts, the signed letter of recommendation by the student's academic advisor, the degree to which the applicant’s academic background supports the proposed research, and the applicant’s curriculum vitae. Evaluation will be conducted by community-based reviewers via either mail or panel review, or both, or by the relevant NASA SMD Division program managers.

The scientific merit of the proposed research includes:

1. The compelling nature of the research topic.
2. The exhibited depth of understanding of the research topic.
3. The expected impact of the research, should it succeed.
4. The feasibility of the proposed research plan, including the availability of resources for successful completion of the project.
5. The robustness of the research plan to anticipated setbacks.

The relevance of the proposed research to NASA’s objectives in Earth or space science is
an assessment of how well the work aligns to priorities summarized in Section 1 above.

Reviewers evaluating applications submitted to the NESSF may consider the following
with respect to the "academic excellence" of a candidate: academic achievement and
capability to successfully complete their proposed project.

* Academic achievement is demonstrated by the candidate’s past performance in coursework and training. Does the candidate’s record of performance demonstrate an ability to excel and to learn?
* Capability to successfully complete their proposed project is demonstrated by the candidate’s past training, achievements, and strategy for graduate study. Has the applicant taken the appropriate coursework to successfully implement their proposed methodology, and do they lay out a plan to gain any skills they are missing? Does their choice of academic advisor or committee complement any lacking skills and training needs? Has the candidate considered cross-disciplinary skills that might enhance the project (i.e., computational techniques, statistical methods, etc)? Has the candidate been involved in any activities within or outsideof academia that make them particularly capable of conducting the proposed work?

A NASA grant officer will conduct a pre-award review of risk associated with the
proposer (i.e., submitting university) as required by 2 CFR 200.205. For all proposals
selected for award, the grant officer will review the submitting university’s information
available through the Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System
(FAPIIS) and the System for Award Management (SAM) to include checks on entity core
data, registration expiration date, active exclusions, and delinquent federal debt. Prior to
making a Federal award with a total amount of Federal share greater than the simplified
acquisition threshold (currently $150,000), NASA is required to review and consider any
information about the proposer that is in the designated integrity and performance system
(currently FAPIIS) accessible through SAM (https://www.sam.gov) (see 41 U.S.C.
2313). A proposer, at its option, may review information in FAPIIS and comment on any 
NESSF18-12
information about itself that NASA previously entered and is currently in FAPIIS. NASA
will consider any comments by the proposer, in addition to the other information in
FAPIIS, in making a judgment about the proposer's integrity, business ethics, and record
of performance under Federal awards when completing the review of risk posed by
proposers as described in 2 CFR 200.205.

Limited Release of Proposers Confidential Business Information. For proposal
processing, NASA may find it necessary to release information submitted by the proposer
to individuals not employed by NASA. Business information that would ordinarily be
entitled to confidential treatment may be included in the information released to these
individuals. Accordingly, by submission of the Phase B proposal, the proposer hereby
consents to a limited release of its confidential business information (CBI). Except where
otherwise provided by law, NASA will permit the limited release of CBI only pursuant to
nondisclosure agreements signed by the assisting contractor or subcontractor, and their
individual employees who may require access to the CBI to perform the assisting
contract.
