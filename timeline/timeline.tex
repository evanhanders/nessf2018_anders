\paragraph{Fall 2014 - Spring 2015:} Began graduate studies and worked as a 
Teaching Assistant.
\vspace{-0.4cm}
\paragraph{Summer 2015:} Began work as a graduate Research Assistant with
	Dr. Benjamin P. Brown. \emph{Awarded CU Boulder's 3-year George Ellery Hale
	Graduate Student Fellowship}.

\vspace{-0.4cm}
\paragraph{Fall 2015:} \emph{Hale fellowship funding began}.

\vspace{-0.4cm}
\paragraph{January 2016:} Completed department qualifier Comprehensive Exam I with
highest marks in cohort.

\vspace{-0.4cm}
\paragraph{Spring-Summer 2016:} Began studies of stratified, compressible convection.

\vspace{-0.4cm}
\paragraph{Fall 2016:} Completed second and final departmental Ph.D. qualifier, Comprehensive
Exam II, which was essentially a master's thesis defense. Received ``High Pass'' distinction,
and advanced to Ph.D. candidacy.

\vspace{-0.4cm}
\paragraph{Spring 2017:} Improved work from Comprehensive Exam II and submitted it to Phys.
Rev. Fluids (published in Summer 2017).  Finished graduate coursework.

\vspace{-0.4cm}
\paragraph{Summer - Fall 2017:}  Started two projects in convection: one studying internally heated,
stratified convection, and another studying how to use boundary value problems (BVPs) to fast-forward
convective solutions in order to save computational time.

\vspace{-0.4cm}
\paragraph{Spring 2018:} Submitted paper on BVPs to Phys. Rev. Fluids.  Continuing
work on internally heated convection.  Getting married April 2018.

\vspace{-0.4cm}
\paragraph{Summer 2018:}  Finalize work on internally heated convection, 
submitting results to The Astrophysical Journal by end of summer.  \emph{End of
funding of Hale fellowship}.

\vspace{-0.4cm}
\paragraph{Fall 2018:} \textbf{\emph{Start of proposed funding from NESSF}}. Determine proper
atmospheric setup for simulations with Kramers' opacity and determine how to control
Mach number of these simulations.

\vspace{-0.4cm}
\paragraph{Spring 2019:} Run final Kramers' opacity simulations, analyze and finalize
results on the effects of Mach number on these simulations.  Submit to The Astrophysical Journal.

\vspace{-0.4cm}
\paragraph{Summer-Fall 2019:} Determine proper atmospheric setup for simulations with
hydrogen ionization and recombination.  Run simulations and analyze data. Submit results
to the Astrophysical Journal.

\vspace{-0.4cm}
\paragraph{Spring 2020:} Write thesis, which will cover the work of the five published papers
above.  Defend thesis and graduate with Ph. D. in Astrophysical \& Planetary Sciences.
